abstract = "Having the ability to coordinate the behavior of stem cells to induce regeneration of specific large-scale structures would have far-reaching consequences in the treatment of degenerative diseases, acute injury, and aging. Thus, identifying and learning to manipulate the sequential steps that determine the fate of new tissue within the overall morphogenetic program of the organism is fundamental. We identified novel early signals, mediated by the central nervous system and 3 innexin proteins, which determine the fate and axial polarity of regenerated tissue in planarians. Modulation of gap junction-dependent and neural signals specifically induces ectopic anterior regeneration blastemas in posterior and lateral wounds. These ectopic anterior blastemas differentiate new brains that establish permanent primary axes re-established during subsequent rounds of unperturbed regeneration. These data reveal powerful novel controls of pattern formation and suggest a constructive model linking nervous inputs and polarity determination in early stages of regeneration."

Despite recent advances in the molecular genetics of stem cell differentiation, this model organism’s remarkable anatomical homeostasis provokes us with truly fundamental puzzles about the origin of large-scale shape and its relationship to the genome. In this review article, we first highlight several deep mysteries about planarian regeneration in the context of the current paradigm in this field. We then review recent progress in understanding of the physiological control of an endogenous, bioelectric pattern memory that guides regeneration, and how modulating this memory can permanently alter the flatworm’s target morphology. Finally, we focus on computational approaches that complement reductive pathway analysis with synthetic, systems-level understanding of morphological decision-making. We analyze existing models of planarian pattern control and highlight recent successes and remaining knowledge gaps in this interdisciplinary frontier field."

Recent successes in manipulating cellular and molecular hardware have not been matched by progress in understanding the patterning software implemented during embryogenesis and regeneration. A fundamental capability gap is driving desired changes in growth and form to address birth defects and traumatic injury. Here we review new tools, results, and conceptual advances in an exciting emerging field: endogenous non-neural bioelectric signaling, which enables cellular collectives to make global decisions and implement large-scale pattern homeostasis. Spatially distributed electric circuits regulate gene expression, organ morphogenesis, and body-wide axial patterning. Developmental bioelectricity facilitates the interface to organ-level modular control points that direct patterning in vivo. Cracking the bioelectric code will enable transformative progress in bioengineering and regenerative medicine.}, journal={Current opinion in biotechnology}, author={Mathews, Juanita and Levin, Michael}, year={2018}, month={Aug}, pages={134–144} }

@article{Pezzulo_Levin_2015, title={Re-membering the body: applications of computational neuroscience to the top-down control of regeneration of limbs and other complex organs}, volume={7}, ISSN={1757-9694}, abstractNote={A major goal of regenerative medicine and bioengineering is the regeneration of complex organs, such as limbs, and the capability to create artificial constructs (so-called biobots) with defined morphologies and robust self-repair capabilities. Developmental biology presents remarkable examples of systems that self-assemble and regenerate complex structures toward their correct shape despite significant perturbations. A fundamental challenge is to translate progress in molecular genetics into control of large-scale organismal anatomy, and the field is still searching for an appropriate theoretical paradigm for facilitating control of pattern homeostasis. However, computational neuroscience provides many examples in which cell networks - brains - store memories (e.g., of geometric configurations, rules, and patterns) and coordinate their activity towards proximal and distant goals. In this Perspective, we propose that programming large-scale morphogenesis requires exploiting the information processing by which cellular structures work toward specific shapes. In non-neural cells, as in the brain, bioelectric signaling implements information processing, decision-making, and memory in regulating pattern and its remodeling. Thus, approaches used in computational neuroscience to understand goal-seeking neural systems offer a toolbox of techniques to model and control regenerative pattern formation. Here, we review recent data on developmental bioelectricity as a regulator of patterning, and propose that target morphology could be encoded within tissues as a kind of memory, using the same molecular mechanisms and algorithms so successfully exploited by the brain. We highlight the next steps of an unconventional research program, which may allow top-down control of growth and form for numerous applications in regenerative medicine and synthetic bioengineering.}, number={12}, journal={Integrative biology: quantitative biosciences from nano to macro}, author={Pezzulo, G. and Levin, M.}, year={2015}, month={Dec}, pages={1487–1517} }

@article{Lyon_2006, title={The biogenic approach to cognition}, volume={7}, ISSN={1612-4782}, abstractNote={After half a century of cognitive revolution we remain far from agreement about what cognition is and what cognition does. It was once thought that these questions could wait until the data were in. Today there is a mountain of data, but no way of making sense of it. The time for tackling the fundamental issues has arrived. The biogenic approach to cognition is introduced not as a solution but as a means of approaching the issues. The traditional, and still predominant, methodological stance in cognitive inquiry is what I call the anthropogenic approach: assume human cognition as the paradigm and work “down” to a more general explanatory concept. The biogenic approach, on the other hand, starts with the facts of biology as the basis for theorizing and works “up” to the human case by asking psychological questions as if they were biological questions. Biogenic explanations of cognition are currently clustered around two main frameworks for understanding biology: self-organizing complex systems and autopoiesis. The paper describes the frameworks and infers from them ten empirical principles--the biogenic “family traits”--that constitute constraints on biogenic theorizing. Because the anthropogenic approach to cognition is not constrained empirically to the same degree, I argue that the biogenic approach is superior for approaching a general theory of cognition as a natural phenomenon.}, number={1}, journal={Cognitive processing}, author={Lyon, Pamela}, year={2006}, month={Mar}, pages={11–29} }
 
@article{Baluska_Levin_2016, title={On Having No Head: Cognition throughout Biological Systems}, volume={7}, ISSN={1664-1078}, abstractNote={The central nervous system (CNS) underlies memory, perception, decision-making, and behavior in numerous organisms. However, neural networks have no monopoly on the signaling functions that implement these remarkable algorithms. It is often forgotten that neurons optimized cellular signaling modes that existed long before the CNS appeared during evolution, and were used by somatic cellular networks to orchestrate physiology, embryonic development, and behavior. Many of the key dynamics that enable information processing can, in fact, be implemented by different biological hardware. This is widely exploited by organisms throughout the tree of life. Here, we review data on memory, learning, and other aspects of cognition in a range of models, including single celled organisms, plants, and tissues in animal bodies. We discuss current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms at work in these systems, and suggest several hypotheses for future investigation. The study of cognitive processes implemented in aneural contexts is a fascinating, highly interdisciplinary topic that has many implications for evolution, cell biology, regenerative medicine, computer science, and synthetic bioengineering.}, journal={Frontiers in psychology}, author={Baluška, František and Levin, Michael}, year={2016}, month={Jun}, pages={902} }
